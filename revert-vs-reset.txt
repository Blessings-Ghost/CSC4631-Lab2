REVERT 
Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit
preserves the history
Safe to use for shared branches
Other team members can pull without issues
 
RESET
Erases commits completely from history
DANGEROUS for shared branches
Moves the branch pointer back to an earlier commit
Only use on local commits that have not been pushed

The Key difference is
Revert preserves history and adds new commit
Reset rewrites history and deletes commits
